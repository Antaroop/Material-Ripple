# Material-Ripple
A few lines of Jquery and CSS to create ripple effects on button.

The few teps to follow:<br />
1. Add JQuery (I have used jquery1.11.3)<br />
2. Add the jQuery code (included in index.html)<br />
3. Add the css (included in index.html)<br />
4. Ho Ho - You are about to jump. Just create buttons with anchor tags and add ".button" class.
